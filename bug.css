The CSS property `calc()` can produce unexpected results if you're not careful with operator precedence and unit mixing. For example, `width: calc(50% - 10px);` works as expected, but `width: calc(50% - 10);` will likely result in an error because the unit is missing from the numerical value.  Another issue can arise from nesting `calc()` expressions, which can become difficult to read and debug. Also, older browsers might have limited support for complex `calc()` expressions.
